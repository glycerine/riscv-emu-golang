### Arm Wrestler

[Link](https://github.com/destoer/armwrestler-gba-fixed/)

The standard version of arm wrestler is not for gba emulation.
Accurate GBA Emulators will fail on Ldm--! instructions, because of differences
in ARMv4 behavior.

(LDM opcodes with writeback: if the base register is included in the register list, writeback never happens)
Additionally, other ARMv5 instructions will fail.
